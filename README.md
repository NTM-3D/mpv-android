### Library?

mpv-android is **not** a library/module (AAR) you can import into your app.

If you'd like to use libmpv in your app you can use our code as inspiration.
The important parts are [`MPVLib`](app/src/main/java/is/xyz/mpv/MPVLib.kt), [`BaseMPVView`](app/src/main/java/is/xyz/mpv/BaseMPVView.kt) and the [native code](app/src/main/jni/).
Native code is built by [these scripts](buildscripts/).

## Downloads

You can download mpv-android from the [Releases section](https://github.com/mpv-android/mpv-android/releases) or
